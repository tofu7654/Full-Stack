## HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language :star:

* uses elements for structuring websites 
* elements contain attributes to further specify element function

### Fundamental Tags :bricks:
* **h1**; for large headers; typically only one per page, h2, h3, h4 get smaller incrementally
* **p**; for paragraphs; write text for paragraph
* **div**; for containing HTML code and elements
* **section**; to divide sections and has semantic meaning
    * Using div and section to group together similar content together is very helpful for styling later
* **a**; for creating hyperlinks to external resources
* **label**; for labeling forms and inputs for better user experience and understanding
* **button**; placing a button onto webpage
* **input**; allowing user to input text to webpage; *placeholder* attribute for message in input bar before user types
* **head**; meta data and title that appears in browser tab for *search engine optimization*
* **nav** contains many tags with links to external resources 

### CSS styling
* whether *in-line styles* or otherwise, uses css; but not best practice
* should create a **css style sheet**
* *in-line* styling is done by adding the *style* attribute to the opening tag of an element.
