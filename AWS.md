# AWS Services Overview

* Cloud Computing - on-demand utilization of IT resources over the internet rather than owning and maintaining physical infrastructure
  * includes compute power, storage, databases on as-needed basis
  * the power to spin up resources allows creativity to flourish, and less time spent on provisioning, configuring server hardware
  * allows access to IT infrastructure for *anyone* as it is so cheap
* elasticity - no need to overprovision resources for heavy workloads, resources scale dynamically to handle traffic
* can deploy applications globally in second, reducing latency
* saves costs as servers do not have to be maintained, only pay for what you use
* **Types of Cloud Computing**: 
  1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - provides the basic IT resources and allows the greatest flexibility. Access to networking, computers, and storage space
  2. Platform as a Service (PaaS) - removes the need to manage any underlying infrastructure and allows focus on the deployment and management of your applications
  3. Software as a Service (SaaS) - a complete product like gmail or any web application; end-user applications where the cloud provider takes care of everything. Just have to decide how to use it.

* **Cloud Services**: 
  * Compute capacity - cloud instances with varying compute power for variety of workloads; basically like you are renting your own computer on the cloud
    * the operating system, memory, CPU, and storage can all be customized
    * no need to maintain it, just use it
  * Databases and Data Storage
    * cloud services for file, block, object storage.
    * SQL and NoSQL database solutions offered
    * also scale based on need
  * Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
  * Network and content delivery
  * Security, Identity, and Compliance
  * Migration and modernization
    * can migrate on-site workloads to cloud without interrupting or causing outages at a fraction of the cost. Also simplifies the decision making process with automation and intelligent recommendations.
